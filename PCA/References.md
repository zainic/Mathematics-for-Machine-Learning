## Books
We tend to write our courses from scratch based on what we think is important to include and introduce things in the order we think presents the material in the most elegant and illuminating way - we don't just go through a particular set textbook. So there isn't an exact 'model text' that we are following in this course. But, our way of thinking about things is informed by the textbooks we use, the teachers who taught us, how we use things in research and by interactions with our own students - so of course all sorts of textbooks are useful.
